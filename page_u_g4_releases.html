<div class="textblock"><p><b>ug4</b> is currently under active development. Below you'll find a list of the latest releases together with a short description of the main features of each release.</p>
<p><br  />
 </p><hr  />
 <h1><a class="anchor" id="secUG4_0_1"></a>
ug4.0.1</h1>
<ul>
<li>Major changes<ul>
<li><p class="startli">The plugin build system has been reworked. Plugins can now be registered through a simple cmake-function call. They can then be enabled or disabled through cmake. Enabled plugins are automatically build alongside with ug4, which completely removes possible build option mismatches between ug4 and its plugins.</p>
<p class="startli">The new system makes it also possible to include registered plugins in static builds of ug4.</p>
<p class="startli">The old plugin build system is still available, however not recommended, since unregistered plugins can not be included in static builds.</p>
</li>

 <h1><a class="anchor" id="secUG4_0_0"></a>
ug4.0.0</h1>
<p>ug4.0.0 is the first release of the <b>ug4</b> simulation environment. While this version does not yet contain all of the planned features of <b>ug4</b>, it already provides a rich simulation , which is used in many different projects.</p>
<p>Below you'll find a list which tries to summarize the current state of ug4. Note that this list is far from complete.</p>
<ul>
<li>General<ul>
<li><b>ug4</b> is a cross platform simulation environment, running on Linux, Mac-OSX and Microsoft Windows. More platforms may well be supported but have not yet been tested.</li>
<li><b>ug4</b> runs on laptops as well as on large scale parallel clusters. Scalability of the provided geometric multigrid solver has been shown for up to 262144 (256ki) processes. It may well show a good scaling behavior for even more processes.</li>
<li><b>ug4</b> has been carefully crafted to allow the execution of applications both in serial and in parallel environments. No changes to the scripts are required, since parallelization is handled internally.</li>
<li><b>ug4</b> not only provides a flexible scripting environment throug the use of the lua scripting language, it also provides bindings to java and the "Visual Programming Languge" vrl. The latter allows to build a simulation while at the same time building its graphical user interface through simple drag and drop operations.</li>
<li><b>ug4</b> provides an interactive shell with auto-completion, method-inspection, script-debugging utilities and much more.</li>
<li>Comprehensive error messages with call-stacks allow to quickly understand what went wrong in a script and where it did so.</li>
<li><b>ug4</b> is extendible through plugins. Classes and algorithms developed in such plugins are immediately available in ug-script and the vrl.</li>
<li>Methods of different plugins can easily be combined on the scripting level.</li>
<li>The sources of ug4 are structured in a modular way, with the main sub-libraries libAlgebra, libDisc (discretization) and libGrid. More libraries like the "parallel communication layer" support those main libraries.</li>
<li>Profiling is available to all applications through the use of the Shiny profiler.</li>
<li>A comprehensive math library for vector calculations in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions (ray-triangle, ray-box, ... intersections, etc).</li>
<li>A unit-testing framework allows to monitor the effect of recent changes and guarantees a stable code-base.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>libAlgebra</b><ul>
<li>Template based implementation, which allows to use highly specialized matrix structures.</li>
<li>Efficient sparse matrix support for arbitrary block types.</li>
<li>Dense matrix types for small block-matrices.</li>
<li>Efficient linear serial and parallel solvers, like 'bicgstab', 'cg', 'feti', 'gauss-seidel', 'ilu', 'jacobi' and 'lu-decomposition'.</li>
<li>Algebraic Multigrid methods: An abstract parallel algebraic multigrid framework including calculation of matrix overlaps, several parallel coarsening algorithms, agglomeration of processors, and a lot of debugging mechanisms for checking at each AMG level: where error is not corrected, what matrix is produced (including graphical output). On implementations we have a Ruge-Stueben AMG, and a Filtering AMG (in development).</li>
<li>a PINVIT/LOBPCG eigensolver (in development).</li>
<li>Tools and utilities to inspect large matrices.</li>
<li>Operators and structures are registered at ug's registry and are thus available both in ug-script and in the vrl.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>libDisc</b><ul>
<li>Highly flexible discretization library, which provides modular discretization building blocks.</li>
<li>Data imports and exports allow the efficient and flexible coupling of different discretization building blocks with each other and with user provided callback functions.</li>
<li>Support for different algebra implementations through the use of template programming.</li>
<li>Prebuild discretization blocks: ...</li>
<li>Efficient and scalable geometric multigrid methods for serial and parallel use. Adaptivity through hanging-nodes is fully supported both in serial and parallel environments.</li>
<li>Fully scriptable through ug-script or vrl-projects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>libGrid</b><ul>
<li>Unstructured hybrid hierarchical grids in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions.</li>
<li>Separation of topology and data allows to associate arbitrary data with elements in the grid - even temporary data may be attached. Data access is typesafe and fast. Management of arbitrary data associated with the elements of a grid is fully automated.</li>
<li>Grids may consist of vertices, edges, faces and volumes. Currently used concrete element-types include vertices, edges, triangles, quadrilaterals, tetrahedrons, pyramids, prisms and hexahedrons.</li>
<li>New grid-element types can easily be added by a user, without the need to change any library related code.</li>
<li>A large set of algorithms operating on grids and related classes. Those algorithms include refinement-, extrusion-, graph- and remeshing- algorithms.</li>
<li>Adaptive refinement using hanging nodes or regular closure is supported.</li>
<li>Adaptive parallel multigrid hierarchies using hanging nodes are available.</li>
<li>Grids may be distributed to an arbitrary amount of processes using user-defined partition maps.</li>
<li>Redistribution and hierarchical redistribution are supported, which allow efficient use of parallel multigrid solvers on large parallel clusters (&gt;100000 procs)</li>
<li>Associated software like ProMesh provides tools to create custom grids ready for simulation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other libraries<ul>
<li><b>common</b>: Contains many different utility classes and functions used e.g. for logging, smart-pointers, serialization, basic math, parsers and profilers and much more.</li>
<li><b>pcl</b> ("Parallel Communication Layer"): MPI-Based communication for distributed memory architectures. Template based structures allow to define process interfaces and layouts, which can be used to communicate data. To minimize buffering overhead, so called CommunicationPolicies are used. The library introduces minimal overhead and can be used for many different applications, due to its template implementation. Currently used by libGrid to distribute grids and to communicate on distributed grids, e.g. during refinement. Also used by libAlgebra to perform necessary communication during matrix- / vector-operations and for the implementation of the parallel amg methods. The pcl internally identifies objects through there positions in associated interfaces and does thus not rely on global id's. If required by a user, global id's can however be efficiently generated.</li>
<li><b>registry</b>: Classes and functions can be registered at the registry through a convenient interface. Function arguments are automatically recognized and are treated in a type-safe way. The registry supports const correctness, multiple inheritance, virtual functions, pass-by-reference as well as raw- and smart-pointer arguments. This means that you can register nearly arbitrary C++ classes and functions. The registry can be queried by different bindings for registered classes and functions. Currently bindings exist, which expose all registered functionality in a coherent way to the lua scripting language and to java / vrl.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Plugins and applications<ul>
<li>Many different plugins are currently in development. Those plugins are currently in an experimental state. The plugins enhance ug through ug's registry. They register new discretization modules or other algorithms, which can then be executed by any ug script.</li>
<li>Plugins currently in development: level_set, membrane_potential_mapping, navier_stokes, neuron, nonlinear_elasticity, tkd_generator, voltage_gated_channels.</li>
<li>Applications are collections of scripts and geometries. Many of them use methods and structures of associated plugins. Here are some applications which are currently under development: adaptive_mg, amg, conv_diff, d3f, eigenvalue, finite_differences, level_set, membrane, navier_stokes, neuro_muscular_junction, neuron, nonlinear_elasticity, pcl_sample, scaling_tests, skin, synaptic_cleft, triggered_calcium_diffusion, tutorials, ugdocu, vol_util. Note that some of those applications may not be in a usable state. </li>
